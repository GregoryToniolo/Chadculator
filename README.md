You may contribute any operations you wish to

Rules for contributing:

Use only <iostream> library for C++.

Comment your code and explain what algorithm/s you are implementing.

Have fun!



## FAQ

#### Why haven't you added "operation/algorithm" yet?

It's either to difficult or i'm just too lazy.

#### Trig functions support when?

When i learn calculus and know how to properly do infinite sums.
